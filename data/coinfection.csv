The growth of bacteria outside of typical skin flora (such asstaphylococcus or streptococcus) was generally considered true posi-tive. If a positive in <3 of four bottles was noted to be a probablecontaminant in the provider notes or infectious disease consultationnotes, and if antibiotics were discontinued before 5 days of treat-ment, growth was classified as a false positive. In cases of disagreement, the discrepancy was resolved through discussion oradjudicated by a third author. Patients in whom no blood cultureswere drawn within 72 h were classified as not bacteremic.

Bacteremia / fungemia was defined as the isolation of a pathogen in one or more blood cultures and for microorganisms of the skin flora, its growth was assessed in two or more blood cultures extracted by different routes. For catheter-associated bacteremia (CAB), the isolation of the same microorganism in blood and at the catheter tip (count ? 103 CFU) from samples obtained in parallel or in two blood cultures taken simultaneously from the catheter and by venipuncture was assessed. Respiratory infection (IR) was considered the significant isolation of a potentially pathogenic microorganism in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), in a bronchial aspirate (BAS) or in a titratable sputum (> 25 PMN and <10 epithelial cells × 100) or the detection in urine of the antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae by immunochromatography using BinaxNOW (Abbot Diagnostics Scarbourg, Maine, USA).

.For microbiological workup, blood was inoculated into
aerobic and anaerobic BC media (BACTEC Plus, Becton
Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) via an automated BC system
(BACTEC Fluorescent Series, Becton Dickinson). Culture
bottles were incubated for 57 days according to the manufacturers recommendations. Considering the difficulty in determining the clinical significance of coagulase-negative
staphylococci (CoNS) in BC, these isolates were reviewed
separately based on the number of positive culture sets, the
presence of intravascular devices, and patients characteristics.
Isolates were considered clinically significant (true
bacteraemia) if two or more bottles yielded the same CoNS.
Primary microbiological cultures of respiratory samples
were performed on Columbia agar, Schaedler agar, and
Chocolate agar (prepared culture media, Becton Dickinson,
Sparks, MD, USA). Gram stain identification, species identification (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation-Time of
Flight Mass Spectrometry, Bruker Daltronics, Leipzig,
Germany), and automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing
(VITEK, bioMerieux, Marcy lEtoile, France) were performed for all relevant pathogens. Anaerobic strains were tested using minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test strips
(Liofilchem Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
German national standards were used to define multidrugresistant gram-negative bacteria [28]. This national classification defines four antibiotic classes with clinical relevance for
treatment of gram-negative infections: carbapenems, quinolones, third-and-fourth-generation cephalosporins and
ureidopenicillins. Multi-resistance of gram-negative pathogens is classified as resistance to three of these classes
